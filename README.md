#  Trying to find the closes point outside an object.

This attempts to find the closest point outside an object when clicking on it.
I had some problems with the "seeker" getting stuck inside Polygon2Ds so i made some rather horrible escape logic. It was developed by "ehh ok lets look at the first function in the docs that seems like it might work" followed by "ehhh ok, it doesnt do exactly what i thought, how can I MAKE it do that". That is **DONT USE THIS AS ANYTHING BUT A LOOSE INSPIRATION/CAUTIONARY TALE**.
